# Frodo — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** confirmation-saints — Catholic Saints iOS App
- **User:** Jorge Balderas
- **Stack:** Swift / SwiftUI, iOS (iPhone + iPad)
- **Description:** App helping Catholic confirmation candidates (primarily teens, also adults) find and choose a patron saint. Features saint search by name, patron day, affinity, country, age, married status. Multilingual (EN/ES). Content sourced from Loyola Press, Focus, Lifeteen, Ascension Press, Hallow with attribution.
- **Key constraints:** Self-contained, easy content updates, cross-platform ready (Android later), include saint images with attribution.

## Learnings

### Architecture Foundation (2026-04-12)
- **Gandalf** established MVVM + SwiftUI with Observable macro (iOS 17+)
- **XcodeGen** generates `CatholicSaints.xcodeproj` from `project.yml`
- **Swift 6 concurrency**: All models are Sendable, services are @MainActor
- **UI localization**: .xcstrings String Catalog for EN/ES UI strings
- Navigate using NavigationStack (not deprecated NavigationView)

### Data Layer Ready (2026-04-12)
- **Samwise** created 25 EN + 25 ES saints with full schema compliance
- Saint data in `SharedContent/saints/saints-en.json` and `saints-es.json`
- Confirmation content in `SharedContent/content/confirmation-info-en/es.json`
- Categories in `SharedContent/categories/categories-en/es.json`
- Affinities field enables teen-focused saint matching (sports, music, art, science, etc.)
- Images with attribution in `SharedContent/images/`

### UI Integration Complete (2026-04-12)
- Dropped `LocalizedText` struct — Samwise's per-language files mean plain String model fields
- Language switching via `@AppStorage("appLanguage")` + custom `EnvironmentValues.appLanguage`
- Single shared `SaintListViewModel` in ContentView, passed to all 5 tabs
- 5 tabs: Saints (browse), Explore (categories), Search (filters), About Confirmation, Settings
- `SaintDataService` loads from `SharedContent/saints/`, `/categories/`, `/content/` subdirectories
- Purple accent theme (liturgical + teen-friendly), SF Symbols, gradient avatars
- `FlowLayout` custom Layout for tag chips, `FilterChip` reusable component
- Category matching is dynamic (computed from saint fields, not pre-indexed)
- Build verified: `xcrun swiftc -typecheck -swift-version 6` passes clean on all 13 files
- XcodeGen regen successful with new view directories

### App Rename & Welcome Screen (2026-07-13)
- App renamed from "Catholic Saints" → "Confirmation Saints" (display name only; folder stays `CatholicSaints/`)
- Updated `project.yml` (INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName, PRODUCT_NAME) and README.md
- Created `Views/Onboarding/WelcomeView.swift` — 4-page TabView onboarding with PageTabViewStyle
- Uses `@AppStorage("hasSeenWelcome")` flag: shown on first launch, skipped after
- `CatholicSaintsApp.swift` conditionally renders WelcomeView vs ContentView
- Settings gets "Show Welcome Screen" button that resets `hasSeenWelcome` to false
- Purple/gold liturgical gradient theme, SF Symbols (cross, magnifying glass, book, sparkles)
- All new strings added to Localizable.xcstrings with EN/ES translations
- Build verified clean with 14 Swift files (added WelcomeView.swift)
- User preference: prefers "Confirmation Saints" as app name

### Category Navigation Bug Fix (2025-07-15)
- `CategorySaintsListView` had a duplicate `.navigationDestination(for: Saint.self)` that conflicted with the parent `NavigationStack` in `CategoryBrowseView`
- Fix: removed the inner `.navigationDestination` — the parent's declaration handles all `NavigationLink(value: saint)` resolution
- Lesson: in SwiftUI, never declare duplicate `.navigationDestination` for the same type at multiple levels of a `NavigationStack` hierarchy — only the outermost one (on/near the `NavigationStack`) should exist

### UI Improvements: Locale, Links, Images, System Integration (2026-04-12)
- Default language now derived from `Locale.current.language.languageCode` — `systemDefaultLanguage` global constant used by both `CatholicSaintsApp` and `SettingsView`
- `@AppStorage` only applies its default when no value previously saved, so existing users keep their manual choice
- `sourceURLs: [String: String]?` added to `Saint` model — optional, backward compatible with older JSON
- Sources section now renders `Link` views for sources with URLs, plain `Text` for others
- Created `SaintImageView` shared component (tries asset catalog → bundle path → fallback initial circle)
- Both `SaintDetailView` and `SaintRowView` now use `SaintImageView` — removed duplicated `colorForSaint` helpers
- App icon redesigned: white dove on red background with Pentecost flames (per user directive)
- **Cross-agent Update:** Samwise populated all 27 saints with `sourceURLs` and standardized source names to English in both language files
- Build verified: `xcrun swiftc -typecheck` passes clean, XcodeGen regen successful
